*Venmo values trust. Please do not share this coding challenge with anyone else.*

Here are the assets you'll need:

  * the mock up for a card form: [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ahrwgnc29tr75r/card-form.png)
  * a card logo sprite: [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbpuqpn8fm35rvl/cardlogos_sprite.png)


You're tasked with:

0. Creating a fully functioning card form that:
    0. Validates a card number via the Luhn-10 Algorithm. (Disregard CVV.)

    0. Changes the card logo inside of the form depending on what type of card is being entered.
        * Bonus points if the logo flips (3D transforms) from default to card type (visa, master card, amex) upon recognition.

    0. If the card is invalid, the card box becomes red. (Please choose a nice shade of red. lol)

    0. When the form is submitted, it should disable itself for 3 seconds and console.log some sort of success.
        * Bonus points if your card form has an API! I.e., If someone wanted to use
          your card form on a random site, how could they go about doing that?

0. Styling the card form to match the mock up.
    * We didn't provide hover state for the button, come up with one. :)

You are free to use whatever tools, frameworks, and libraries you deem fit. *Hint:* we love tests.
